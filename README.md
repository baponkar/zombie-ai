Although I have put all necessary files in this package but
this Assets depend on ['Zombie assets by Pxltiger'](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/zombie-30232) and
 ['Standard Assets(for Unity 2018.4) by Unity Technologies'](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/zombie-30232).
You just need to download this repo and put inside of your project asset folder.


You may get some error in Unity Standard assets like 'GUITEXT'
you need to fix that issue by putting 'using Unity.Engine.UI' and replace 'GUITEXT' with 'TEXT'.

This asssets has a Zombie NPC which have Patrol,Idle,Chase Player, Attack and Death State.
It also has ability to call other near NPC for help to attack Player.
Which sensed Player by Vision Sensor and sound sensor.It can call other near NPC to attack Player.

If Player has attached PlayerHealth Script  then it can make damage to the player health.
The NPC control configaration can be control by 'NPC Agent Config' Asset menu.

The NPC Debug is showing by enabling 'DebugNavmeshAgent' and you can see Vison Sensor and Sound Sensor.

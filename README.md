## Documentation :
* This is a complete Unity Project with included depending assets and also included a Demo Scene.

* If You download this project and  open it with Unity then it may works perfectly but sometimes may not works the way because of layers absence in the project then you need to add  corresponding layers and set by the below instruction.


* If you use this project with your old project then first put '_Zombie_ai_Fsm' folder in your project then create and add the layers in your project by below instruction.
Zombie NPC is a navmesh agent which detect player by using vision sensor and sound sensor.Vison Sensor have a sensory memory to memorize sense which can be set by config scriptable object.

* vison sensor can sense **Character** layers which is attached to the player prefab.

* The NPC Zombie have different inter related states you can manage those states by set up in config scriptable object found in the project.

* Project setup instructions:
---
1. Add following layers in the following orders 

- [x] Layer 3 - **Player**
- [x] Layer 6 - **NPC**
- [x] Layer 13 - **Character**
- [x] Layer 14 - **Mini Map**

2. NPC  : Change Default layer of  Zombie/Romero Prefab into **NPC**, and also
 Change Tag  of  Zombie/Romero Prefab into **NPC**.

3. Change Layer of **Player** into **Character** which will be seen by NPCs, and also
Change Tag of **Player** with "**Player**".

4. Change Layer of all prefabs **indicator plane** into "**Mini Map**" Layer.Which will be seen only by Mini Map Camera.

5. See **NPCVisionSensor** Script which attached with npcs i.e. zombie/Romero prefabs and change its **Occulation Layer** with corresponding
**Ground Layer** i.e. if ground plain be **Defult** then change into **Defult** Layer.

6. See NPCVisionSensor.cs Script which attached with npcs i.e. zombie/Romero prefabs and change its **Target Layer** into **Character** Layer which is the Layer of Player.So NPCs can see the player by vision sensor.


7. Bake Navmesh with Humanoid Agent which should be in NavMeshAgent(Which attached to the Zombie Prefab).

8. Now put zombie prefab and player prefab in your scene.Player has attached a Health script which is damageable by Zombie/Romero.

9. Zombie also has attached a Health Script which can be damagable by external player which has a weapon which can be used to damage zombies health.

10. Change or tweak zombie behavior by setting up zombie config scriptable object.

11. To Change custom sensor detection layer edit 'NPCSensoryMemory.cs' file

12. If you don't see the npcs then you need to add 'NPC' layer into the culling mask section of FPSCamera which have attached to theplayer prefab

## Zombie sensor sense *Character* Layer for this NPCSensoryMemory.cs Script.
